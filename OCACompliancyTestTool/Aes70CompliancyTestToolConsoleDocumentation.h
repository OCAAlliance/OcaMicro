/**
 * @mainpage AES70 Compliancy Test Tool Console User Manual
 * The AES70 Compliancy Test Tool is a verification tool for compliancy of devices supporting AES70 to the AES70 specifications. 
 * The tool offers a way to check if AES70 devices are interoperable (on a basic level) with other AES70 devices.
 * A console window to run the tool can be opened by selecting the tool in the Windows start menu. 
 * This documentation describes how to use the tool to test compliancy of an AES70 device and contains the following sections:
 * - @ref octtcli
 * - @ref octtcompatibility
 * - @ref octtlogging
 */

/**
 * @page octtcli Command Line Options
 * The following command line options are available:
 *
 * Option                               | Description
 * -------------------------------------|-------------
 * -d &lt;device name&gt;               | Mandatory parameter that specifies the name of the device to be tested.
 * -s &lt;supported services&gt;        | Mandatory parameter that specifies the services the device will be expected to support. Options are <b>TCP</b>, <b>TCP-SEC</b>, and <b>UDP</b>.  Multiple values may be appended with \| as separator.
 * -v &lt;aes70 version&gt;             | Mandatory parameter that specifies the AES70 specification version to be used. Options are <b>AES70-2015</b> and <b>AES70-2018</b>.
 * -l &lt;loglevel&gt;                  | Optional parameter that indicates the logging level. Options are <b>TRACE</b>, <b>INFO</b>, <b>WARNING</b>, and <b>ERROR</b>. <b>ERROR</b> is the default.
 * -t &lt;device type&gt;               | Optional parameter that specifies addtional device attributes. Options are:<br><br><b>SECURE</b>, which means the device will be expected to register itself as a secure device, and <br><br> <b>STREAMING</b>, which means the device will be expected to implement the required minimum streaming I/O objects.  Multiple values may be appended with \| as separator.<br><br>To verify a secure device completely, both <b>-t SECURE</b> and <b>-s TCP-SEC</b> must be specified.  The <b>-t</b> option checks the device's registration; the <b>-s</b> option checks the device's protocol support.

 *
 * Examples of valid commands are:<br />
 * <code>Aes70CompliancyTestToolConsole.exe -t MyFirstOCADevice -s UDP|TCP -v AES70-2018</code><br />
 * <code>Aes70CompliancyTestToolConsole.exe -t MyFirstOCADevice -s UDP|TCP -v AES70-2018 -l INFO -t SECURE|STREAMING </code><br />
 * <code>Aes70CompliancyTestToolConsole.exe -t MyFirstOCADevice -s TCP-SEC|TCP -v AES70-2015  -t SECURE</code>
 */

/**
 * @page octtcompatibility Compatibility
 * The AES70 Compliancy Test Tool is both backward and forward compatible.<br /><br />
 * <b>Backward compatibility:</b> By definition AES70 will remain backward compatible due to the rules that have been set inside the specification 
 *                        all classes are versioned, properties methods and events of approved versions may never be removed and the class
 *                        version is raised if something is added. The AES70 Compliancy Test Tool will use a specific attribute in the XML file containing the
 *                        OCC class definitions that will make sure that the AES70 Compliancy Test Tool knows what parts belong to what class version. The AES70 Compliancy Test Tool 
 *                        will check the class version of each object of a device and only test the parts belonging to that class version 
 *                        This way the AES70 Compliancy Test Tool offers full backward compatibility, objects of older class versions will not lead to failing tests.<br /><br />
 * <b>Forward compatibility:</b> This is handled by updating the XML file containing the OCC class definitions (ReferenceOCCMembers.xml). 
 *                        The AES70 Compliancy Test Tool is kept up-to-date with any changes that are made to the AES70 specification (specifically the OCC part). 
 *                        The ReferenceOCCMembers.xsd is the XML schema definition that can be used to verify the correct syntax of ReferenceOCCMembers.xml.  
 *                        As soon as changes have been approved a new version of the AES70 Compliancy Test Tool containing an updated XML file will be released, 
 *                        thereby guaranteeing forward compatibility (i.e. always being up-to-date with the specification).<br /><br />

/**
 * @page octtlogging Logging
 * The test run log file of the AES70 Compliancy Test Tool will contain detailed logging of the compliancy test run that is executed on the device.
 * The test result log file will contain the overall test result.
 * For each test a new log file and test result file will be generated. The name and location of this log file are fixed to %programdata%\OCAAlliance\CompliancyTestTool
 * The log file will contain detailed 
 * test results for all executed test steps. The following example shows an excerpt of the log file:
 * <pre>
Starting Test : OCA Service Discovery

Testing DNS-SD for resolved service CAP6-000181._oca._tcp.local.
   Port for service CAP6-000181._oca._tcp.local. validated (port 55555)
   At least 2 txt records must be present. Result success
   Successfully validated TXT records
Testing basic connection for resolved service CAP6-000181._oca._tcp.local.
   Established connection (1) for service CAP6-000181._oca._tcp.local.
   OcaBlock.GetMembersRecursive returns status 0, nr members 271. Expecting OK. Test Passed

 *
 * Next to the logging in the log file, the AES70 Compliancy Test Tool will also write a summary to the console. The following example shows what this console output may look like:
 * <pre>
Test Result Summary for device TestDevice:
   5 tests executed
   5 tests passed
   0 tests failed
